## Why am I having issues connecting to DanBot Hosting?

Cloudflare WARP by sets the `.host` TLD as a local domain fallback automatically. That means it will try to request the DNS information from your local network.

This makes sense for intranets that have a `.host` domain as their intranet domain. The issue is it's a **public TLD**, so .host is also used on many internet facing sites, such as DanBot Hosting, specifically `danbot.host`.

## How do I fix it?

### 1. Open WARP Client:

!!!info Info
Do note that removing `.host` will result in all `.host` to be resolved by external DNS and not local. This may or may not break your DNS setup.
