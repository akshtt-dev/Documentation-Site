# Uptime Kuma

[Uptime Kuma](https://uptimekuma.org/) is a self-hosted monitoring tool used to check whether websites, servers, or services are online.

## Requirements

- Have an Pterodactyl account created and linked to the panel. [Click here if you have not done so already.](/getting-started)

## Creating the Server

To create a free server, go into `#⌛╏commands` and run `DBH!server create uptimekuma [optional server name]` to create a free server. Once you have done so, the bot should return the following output.

If you are creating a donator server, instead run: `DBH!server create-donator uptimekuma [optional server name]`

## Starting the Server

Navigate to the `Console` section of your server and click Start.
The system will automatically install the latest version of Uptime Kuma.

Once the installation is complete, open your server’s assigned address in a browser to finish the setup by creating an admin account.
